==========
Breadcrumb
==========
Display a breadcrumb of currently viewed node:
order-lg--1 -> All elements have order:0 by default; setting order-lg--1 we set order:-1 only for "Large" mode. We need to do this because we set the 1st Side too as order-lg--1, so we have to set it also for Breadcrumb to mantain it before the 1st Side.

p-x-1 -> set default single padding on X axis (left + right).
