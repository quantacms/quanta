<!--
 This template contains the main structure for all nodes in the pages folder.
 Feel free to review all the inline comments, to better understand how things are done.
 Then, you can delete them :-)!

===========
Breadcrumb
===========
Display a breadcrumb of currently viewed node:
order-lg--1 -> All elements have order:0 by default; setting order-lg--1 we set order:-1 only for "Large" mode. We need to do this because we set the 1st Side too as order-lg--1, so we have to set it also for Breadcrumb to mantain it before the 1st Side.

-->
[BREADCRUMB|grid=order-lg--1]

<!--
===========
Main content
===========
We are giving those grid attributes to the main content:

grid-start-lg-3 -> Start from cell "3" when in "Large" (desktop, laptop) mode.
grid-span-md-8  -> Column span of 8 cells when in "Medium" (tablet) mode.
p-x -> set default single padding on column.
p-y3 -> set default triple padding on row.

The referenced node for content structure is _content-basic (see _components/_content-basic).
-->
[MAIN|grid=grid-start-lg-3 grid-span-md-8 p-x p-y3:_content-basic]

<!--
===========
1st Sidebar
===========
We are giving those grid attributes to the first sidebar:
order-lg--1 -> order:-1 before all elements with default order (0).
grid-start-lg-1 -> Start from cell "1" when in "Large" (desktop, laptop) mode.
grid-span-md-4 -> Column span of 4 cells when in "Medium" (tablet) mode.
p-x -> set default single padding on column.
p-y3 -> set default triple padding on row.
text-left -> align text on left by default.

The referenced node for content structure is _side-first (see _components/_side-first).
-->
[ASIDE|grid_id=side-first|grid=order-lg--1 grid-start-lg-1 grid-span-md-4 grid-span-lg-2 p-x p-y3 text-left:_side-first]

<!--
===========
2nd Sidebar
===========
We are giving those grid attributes to the second sidebar:
grid-span-lg-2  -> Column span of 2 cells when in "Large" (desktop, laptop) mode.
p-x -> set default single padding on column.
p-y3 -> set default triple padding on row.
